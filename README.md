# University Course Schedule Web Application

## Overview

This web application provides students with an intuitive interface to access and manage their class schedules. Developed using React.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database, it offers a seamless experience for viewing and updating course information.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**:
  - **Registration**: Users can create new accounts by providing necessary details, which are validated and stored in the database.
  - **Login**: Users can log in using their credentials. The system verifies the entered data against the records in the database, granting access upon successful authentication.

- **Class Schedule Display**:
  - Users can view class schedules for all three years of the bachelor's program. Data is dynamically loaded from the database through API calls, ensuring accuracy and up-to-date information.

- **University Links**:
  - Active links to the university's social media profiles and the official website are available in the footer of the website for easy access.

## Architecture

The project is structured into two main directories:

- **`backend/`**:
  - **`authDatabase.js`**: Configures the connection to the PostgreSQL database for authentication.
  - **`scheduleDatabase.js`**: Configures the connection to the PostgreSQL database for class schedules.
  - **`queries.js`**: Contains SQL queries for interacting with the databases.
  - **`server.js`**: Contains the server logic, including request handling and routing.

- **`frontend/`**:
  - **`public/`**: Contains static assets such as images and icons.
  - **`src/`**:
    - **`assets/`**: Contains files like logos and photographs.
    - **`features/`**: Contains Redux slices (`authSlice` and `scheduleSlice`) for state management.
    - **`pages/`**: Contains all pages available for display in the application.
    - **`services/`**: Contains functions for making API requests to the backend.
    - **`ui/`**: Contains UI components such as buttons, headers, footers, and loaders.

## API Endpoints

- **Authentication**:
  - `POST /auth/login`: Logs in a user with provided credentials.
  - `POST /auth/signup`: Registers a new user with provided details.

- **Schedule**:
  - `GET /schedule/firstYear`: Retrieves the class schedule for the first year.
  - `GET /schedule/secondYear`: Retrieves the class schedule for the second year.
  - `GET /schedule/thirdYear`: Retrieves the class schedule for the third year.

- **Information**:
  - `GET /info`: Provides information about the website and contact details.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to both the `frontend` and `backend` directories and install the required dependencies.

   For the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

   For the backend:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed and running on your machine.
   - Create a new database and tables as per the projectâ€™s requirements.
   - You can manage the database directly using pgAdmin or a PostgreSQL client.

4. **Run the Backend**:
   Start the backend server by running:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the server, and the API will be available for the frontend to interact with.

5. **Run the Frontend**:
   In a new terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory and start the React application:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the application in your browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5174 (for the client)
   http://localhost:8081 (for the server)_ 
   ```


This section covers the basic setup instructions for cloning the repository, installing dependencies, setting up the database, and running both the frontend and backend.
